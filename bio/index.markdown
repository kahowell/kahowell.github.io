I grew up in a small town in Southwest Virginia. I attended the
[College of William of Mary][wm.edu] in Williamsburg, VA, and earned a
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. After I graduated, I moved to Northern
Virginia for a job as a technical consultant (developer). I am currently
located in the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina.

I am a big advocate of free and open source software, because I believe
software efforts should benefit the greater good — and not just individual
persons or companies. I believe open source is the smarter way to build
software.
