I've been tinkering with Apache Cordova lately. After looking through
[F-Droid's repo](https://f-droid.org), and not finding a whole lot of recipe
apps, I decided to build a recipe collection app.

The name is from the Japanese word 料理 which means cooking or cuisine; the
romaji (romanized spelling) for this is "ryouri".

I pushed it out to [GitHub](https://github.com/kahowell/ryouri_book), in
the hope that folks will find it interesting enough to take a look and
potentially contribute.
