I've been tinkering with Apache Cordova lately. After looking through
[F-Droid's repo](https://f-droid.org), and not finding a whole lot of recipe
apps, I decided to build a recipe collection app.

Source is up at: https://github.com/kahowell/ryouri_book

The name is from the Japanese word 料理 which means cooking or cuisine; the
romaji (romanized spelling) for this is "ryouri".

I pushed it out to GitHub, in the hope that folks will find it interesting
enough to pick it up and start contributing.
