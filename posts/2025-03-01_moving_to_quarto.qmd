I've grown quite fond of Quarto for doing presentations, so I'm migrating my blog from Jekyll to Quarto. A few hints for anyone who wants to do the same:

1. You can create directory structures for old posts that mirror any permalinks you had set in Jekyll. For example, I created a directory `2015/08` and put my post from then there, renamed to ensure the generated `html` file ends up with desired name (`ryouri_book.html` in this case).
2. Configure listings to include old content manually. See [Quarto docs on YAML Listing Content](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#yaml-listing-content) for details.
3. You can use `categories` much the same way as Jekyll `tags`.
4. Any content you want quarto to just copy over needs to be listed in `_quarto.yml` under `project` -> `resources`.
