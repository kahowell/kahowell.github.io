Around 200 billion USD at time of writing
In fact, I'm moving to an AI team at Red Hat

## Tough Market

- Applicant to job ratio
- Inflation
- Interest rates
- Investment in AI

I just went through a job search
Effective interest rates used to be 0% or close to 0% for software

# Job Hunting {background-image="ran-berkovich-kSLNVacFehs-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

## Recruiting Cycles

- Cycles tend to be quarterly
- Summer and late fall are slower

## Internships

- But don't give up looking

## Roles

- Backend Engineer
- Frontend Engineer
- Fullstack Engineer
- Technical Writer
- Data Engineer
- AI Engineer
- Quality Engineer

## Job Boards at Conferences

- Employers recruit at conferences

## Saved Searches

1. Look for jobs on a company's website
2. Set up a "saved search" or "alert"

## Down-leveling

- Sometimes employers compromise
- Sometimes bringing in fresh talent is valuable in itself

::: {.notes}

Can be because of:

- lack of talent with the desired experience
- budget considerations

:::

## Consider All Industries

- Healthcare/Life Sciences
- Finance
- Retail
- Technology
- Non-Profit
- Academia

## Consider Contract-to-Hire

- Work as a contractor for 6 months to year
- Then convert to full-time or find something else

::: {.notes}

Benefits are tied to the contracting company

# Interviews {background-image="christina-wocintechchat-com-eF7HN40WbAQ-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

## Embrace In-Person/Hybrid

- Early career
- Mentorship

::: {.notes}

Make it clear you're okay with in-person.
Companies often find on-boarding/mentorship easier in-person.

:::

## Practice Coding Interviews

- HackerRank
- Advent of Code
- Beware of interviewing scams

## Show Continuous Learning

- Talk about microlearning or side-projects

## Do NOT Lie

- Or make up answers
- Instead admit you don't know, relate to something you *do* know
